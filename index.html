                <p><em>M.D., Ph.D., is a renowned scientist and a founding member of the Avengers.</em></p>
                <br>
                <p>Highly respected for his work in Biochemistry, Nuclear Physics, and Gamma Radiation, Banner was commissioned by Thaddeus Ross to recreate the Super Soldier Serum that created Captain America. However, Ross elected not to inform Banner what he was creating. During the experiment, Banner was exposed to dangerous levels of gamma radiation (rather than vita radiation). As a result, the mild-mannered scientist found that when angered, provoked, or excited, his body and brain would transform into a huge, rage-fueled, primitive-minded creature known as Hulk.</p></td>

    <h2>Becoming the Hulk</h2>
    <p>Banner was present in the instrumentation bunker at the test site for the first underground test detonation of the Gamma Bomb. Observing that a civilian had breached security and entered the restricted test area, Banner told his colleague Igor Starsky to delay the countdown while he tried to get the civilian to safety. Starsky, secretly a Russian agent, did nothing, confident that Banner would die in the explosion, bringing the project to a halt. Reaching the civilian, a teenager named Rick Jones, Banner threw him into a protective trench. Before Banner could get himself to safety, the Gamma Bomb detonated, and intense waves of radiation reached the surface. Banner was irradiated with highly charged radioactive particles. Due to an unknown genetic factor in his body, Banner was not killed by the radiation, which instead caused him to frequently transform into the vastly powerful, green-skinned, humanoid monster named "the Hulk" by a military soldier present at the test site, though in flashbacks he seemed to already refer to his other personality as "the Hulk".

        At first Banner changed into the Hulk at sunset and reverted to human form at dawn. However, Banner's body eventually changed so that his transformations into Hulk were triggered by the release of adrenalin when he became intensely excited, no matter what time of day or night it was. Usually the Hulk possessed little of Banner's memory and intelligence and was easily enraged. While the military attempted to contain Hulk, he thwarted their every attempt, with Rick Jones, feeling responsibile for Banner becoming Hulk, trying to help him keep away from the military. Hulk ultimately thwarted an attempt to destroy America by the Gremlin, another being mutated by gamma radiation. Hulk changed back into Banner and help cure the Gremlin, who helped Banner escape back to the U.S., where, with the help of Rick Jones, maintained his identity as Hulk a secret and attempted to keep the Hulk contained at night.
        
        When Gamma Base was the subject to sabotage, Hulk was blamed and the Fantastic Four were called in to deal with him. This lead to the first of many clashes between Hulk and the Fantastic Four's Thing. In the aftermath, it was revealed that scientist Karl Kort (posing as the Wrecker) was ultimately responsible.</p>

    <h2>Joining the Avengers</h2>
    <p>Hulk next became a pawn of Loki who tried and tricked Hulk into battling his half-brother, Thor. This plot was foiled, leading to Hulk joining forces with the newly formed Avengers, Thor, Iron Man, Black Widow, Captain America and Hawkeye to defeat Loki.</p>
